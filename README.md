# Soccer Ball Tracking using Object Detection Models
This project implements a soccer ball tracking system using YOLOv11 on a Raspberry Pi. The system uses a camera feed to detect and track a soccer ball, adjusting servo motors to keep the ball centered in the frame. This setup is ideal for sports recording applications, providing an automated solution to follow the game ball in real time.
